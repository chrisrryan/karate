### Just want to give a shout out for my senior instructors. 

This team of highly skilled and knowledgeable instructors are here to help you learn. All instructors are licensed and insured through The British Martial Arts and Boxing Association.

They have many years of training and teaching behind them and all hold genuine and traceable high rankings in Jim Hulse’s Uechi Ryu Karate.
